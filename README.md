# MoodWearApp
 Android WearOS app. Keeps track of your mood and has a distraction counter

 ----This project is under development-----

 As of now, 
 1. You can simply select a mood and your preferred choice gets saved to a database.
 2. Keep a track of the number of times you are getting distracted.
 
 Upcoming commits will have a companion
 Android app included where you can visualize your mood swings in terms of graphs.
